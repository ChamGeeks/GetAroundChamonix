# Geo-tree library

Geo-tree library is a tool for working with map objects. The primary use-case is
creating a set of map-related objects (i.e. each of them having its latitude,
longitude and data), followed with a queries to find objects in given area
(exact match / rectangular area / circle area).

The existing code we used for this purpose originally (that was part of (one of
the many available) google map directives) was not performant enough
(it scanned the whole set of objects sequentially each time), so our goal was to
speed the find queries using some clever data structures and algorithms.

After some prototyping and testing, we decided to wrap our `GeoTree`
implementation around red-black binary search trees using z-curve algorithm for
converting 2D plane coordinates into scalar index (and using this index as the
numeric key in underlaying red-black tree).

This way, the `find()` operation doesn't need to go through the whole list, but
we can eliminate a lot of items for which we know in advance that we don't need
to consider them based on provided search criteria.

So when using hundreds or thousands or even more objects in your map application
and having performance issues, may find this library very useful.

## Installation

In `node.js` environment, just do the usual:

    npm install geo-node --save

Since that moment on, you can use it as:

    var GeoTree = require('geo-tree');
    var gt = new GeoTree();
    // use it as you like

If you want to use it in the browser directly, add a `<script>` tag with the
built library into your html:

    <script src="geo-tree.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

And then you can use `window.GeoTree` constructor function that is exported by
the library the same way as in `node.js`:

    <script>
      var gt = new GeoTree();
      // use it as you like
    </script>

If you need the `GeoTree` constructor function to be exported under different
name, see the build procedure below...

## Build procedure

If you want to build the library (that can be used as `<script>` tag in your
HTML code) from the `node.js` sources, make sure you have `gulp` client
installed along with `nmp` utility. Then issue:

    $ npm install
    $ gulp

This will build you the library and its minified version into `lib` directory.

The symbol, under which the main `GeoTree` constructor function is exported, is
defined in `package.json` file under `export-symbol` key. By default, it has
`GeoTree` value, so the constructor is available as `window.GeoTree` name. If
you need the constructor to be available under different name, just edit the
`export-symbol` key in `package.json` and build the library again.

## Tests

The code is unit tested using `mocha` testing framework together with unit test
coverage tool `istanbul`. All `.spec.js` files are in `test` directory.

There are also two more files in `test` directory:
* `benchmark.js`: there are some performance related tests, I use them to make
  sure code updates don't have any negative impacts on performance, and
* `test.js`: where I test ideas, API, ...

These tests are executed in `node`.

The unit test coverage reports are generated into `test/coverage` directory, so
when editing / adding new features to the library yourself, make sure tests still
pass, or that you actually add unit tests for new functionality as needed.

## API

### Constructor

The `GeoTree` constructor function is the only exported object for both `node`
and standalone browser library versions.

So in `node`, you get access to it as:

    var GeoTree = require('geo-tree');

and in browser you use the `<script>` tag:

    <script src="geo-tree.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

To create new empty set (tree), do:

    var set = new GeoTree();

### Insert

To insert geo-related items into the `set`, use `insert()` function. Each
inserted item must have latitude `lat`, longitude `lng`, and associated data
`data`.

Supported ranges:
* `lat`: `-90.0` .. `+90.0`
* `lng`: `-180.0` .. `+180.0`
* `data`: any value

Assume we want to insert:

    lat: 48.85886, lng:  2.34706, data: 'Paris, France'
    lat: 52.50754, lng: 13.42614, data: 'Berlin, Germany'
    lat: 50.05967, lng: 14.46562, data: 'Prague, Czech Republic'

Function `insert()` can be invoked with single parameter: object

    {
      lat: ...,
      lng: ...,
      data: ...
    }

So you would invoke it 3 times to insert the above 3 items, inserting one each
time, e.g. to insert Paris, you'd do:

    set.insert({lat: 48.85886, lng: 2.34706, data: 'Paris, France'});

For bulk insert, you can pass an array of the above mentioned objects, they will
be inserted sequentially. So to insert all 3 of them in one `insert()`
invocation, you'd do:

    set.insert([
      {lat: 48.85886, lng:  2.34706, data: 'Paris, France'},
      {lat: 52.50754, lng: 13.42614, data: 'Berlin, Germany'},
      {lat: 50.05967, lng: 14.46562, data: 'Prague, Czech Republic'}
    ]);

Last option is to pass `lat`, `lng` and `data` as 3 arguments to `insert()`,
which will insert one item with associated coordinates and data. E.g. to insert
Prague, you'd do:

    set.insert(50.05967, 14.46562, 'Prague, Czech Republic');

There is no need to have unique `lat`, `lng` pairs when inserting the items.

### Find

To find items based on some geographical relation, use `find()` function. The
function returns *array* of `data` fields of inserted items.

The order in which you'll get the found items in the resulting array is
determined by underlaying red-black tree, so do not expect to see the `data`
fields to be in any specific order.

With no argument, i.e. `set.find()`, the function returns array of the `data`
field of *all* the inserted items.

    set.find();
    // --> ['Prague, Czech Republic', 'Paris, France', 'Berlin, Germany']

Specifying single object argument `{lat: ..., lng: ...}`, the function returns
`data` fields of items that match the position exactly.

    set.find({lat: 48.85886, lng: 2.34706});
    // --> ['Paris, France']

You can pass two `lat`/`lng` objects to `find()`, in which case it will return
`data` fields of the items in rectangle defined by the two coordinates (the
arguments are treated as two diagonal vertices of a rectangle).

    set.find({lat: 45, lng: 0}, {lat: 55, lng: 14});
    // --> ['Paris, France', 'Berlin, Germany']

Finally, you can pass one `lat`/`lng` object, a float number, and optionally a
string. These parameters are making up a circle (with provided center and
radius) in which you search for the items. If you don't provide the third string
argument, the units for the provided radius value are native to latitude and
longitude (i.e. angle degrees). If you want to specify different units for
radius, select one of the following: `m` for meters, `km` for kilometers, `yd`
for yards, and `mi` for miles. In case you pass any other string, it is ignored
and the value is not converted.

    set.find({lat: 51, lng: 14}, 2.0);
    // --> ['Prague, Czech Republic', 'Berlin, Germany']

    set.find({lat: 51, lng: 17}, 200.0, 'mi');
    // --> ['Prague, Czech Republic', 'Berlin, Germany']

### Iteration over all items

`GeoTree` supports `forEach` method to which you pass a callback that takes
single argument. We iterate over all items in the set and invoke provided
callback, passing `data` field of the item.

    set.forEach(function(data) { console.log(data); });
    /* prints to console:
         Paris, France
         Prague, Czech Republic
         Berlin, Germany
    */

Same as for the `find()` method: the order passed `data` items to the callback
is determined by underlaying red-black tree structure, so do not expect to see
the callbacks invoked in any particular order.

### For debugging: dump    

For debugging purposes and for the purposes of unit tests, there is `dump()`
method that either prints the internal representation of the current stored set
to the console (no argument, or falsey argument passed), or generates a string
that describes the the tree (single truthy argument passed).
